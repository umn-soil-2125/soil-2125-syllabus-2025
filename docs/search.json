The lab has open hours (see Section 4) and is self-paced so you can return as often as needed to complete the lab exercises (Laboratory TA’s will be in the lab during all open hours to help you). Make sure you sign in and out and complete the pre-lab checklist using the posted QR code at the TA desk.\nAssessment of Learning: There are no exams in this class. In place of exams, we will be assessing your learning with weekly quizzes based on lecture material and a Soil Properties and Land Use Report (SPLUR) that will be completed in 4 parts, one part at the end of each unit.

These materials will also be printed and distributed in class when necessary for use. All distributed course materials will come three hole punched so it is recommended that you maintain a three-ring binder for this course.\nTextbook (Recommended Only) No textbook is required for this course. However, if you need a reference or if you are planning on continuing your work with and study of soils in the future, I recommend the text, which is available from most online booksellers. There are two versions of the recommended text, and many editions. The full version (more than 1,000 pages) is called The Nature and Properties of Soils by Ray Weil and Nyle Brady and is on its 15th Edition (2016 for hardcover/2022 for paperback). The abridged version is called Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils also by Ray Weil and Nyle Brady and is on its 4th Edition (2018). Note that the 15th edition of the full text and the 4th edition of the abridged text are the newest, but the previous 14th (full version) and 3rd (abridged version) editions work just as well and are generally much cheaper to purchase from online book sellers. The course schedule has recommended readings from the 4th edition of Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils or the 14th Edition (paperback) of The Nature and Properties of Soils:\nOR\nCourse Website: Lecture notes and other course materials will be available on the class website through Canvas.

During a typical week, you will have a Pre-Discussion Quiz due on Canvas by Wednesday at 11:59PM, a live discussion session in 174 Plant Growth Facilities on Thursdays, and a Weekly Summary Quiz due by Friday at 11:59PM.\nYou will complete the lab at a time of your choosing between Wednesday and Friday each week. You’ll sign up for a lab timeslot during the first week of class. We hope that this helps structure your schedule and your interaction with the asynchronous lecture materials.\nCourse materials will be posted at least one week in advance, so you are free to work on a schedule that works best for you. If you engage with all of the lecture and lecture companion materials, attend discussion sections and lab at your chosen time, you will be very familiar with the material and should be successful in the class.\nCome to discussion prepared to participate! Unit summaries, zoom sessions, and additional materials on the Canvas site will provide you with the tools for success. We really look forward to meeting and working with you.\nYou are encouraged to ask any and all questions - even the “stupid” ones! (P.S. There are no stupid questions ;).",

    "text": "3.1 Assignments and Points (742 points)1\nLecture Questions (54 points, 7% of your grade)\nEvery required lecture will have live polls (through Poll Everywhere) that contain at least one question which is used for attendance and participation purposes, i.e. you don’t need to answer the question correctly to get full points. However, the questions will also serve as review. Lecture questions are answered through Poll Everywhere or by paper (in case your phone is not working correctly) in lecture. There are 31 lectures throughout the semester and you will get full credit for attending 27 of them. Attending additional lectures beyond the 27 required will count as extra credit points. There is no make- up work for lecture questions! (27 lectures X 2 points = 54 points).\nPre-Discussion Quiz (30 points, 4% of your grade)\nSome weeks (see schedule), you will be required to complete a short pre-discussion quiz on Canvas. The pre-discussion quiz will ensure you are prepped for small group and active learning activities in discussion. These quizzes are not timed and you have two attempts should you choose to use them. Pre-discussion quizzes are worth 5 points each and are due on Wednesdays by 11:59PM. All materials will be posted 1 week in advance and you are free to complete the quizzes any time before the due dates. (6 quizzes x 5 points = 30 points).\nWeekly Summary Quiz (300 points, 39% of your grade)\nThe weekly summary quiz will be on Canvas and will cover material from lecture, lecture companion materials, lab, and discussion. These quizzes are not timed and you have two attempts should you choose to use them. Each weekly summary quiz is worth 20 points and is due on Fridays by 11:59PM. All materials will be posted 1 week in advance and you are free to complete the quizzes any time before the due days. (15 quizzes x 20 points = 300 points).\nDiscussion Team Exercises (84 points, 12% of your grade)\nDuring our Thursday discussion sessions, you will be collaborating in small groups (3-4 students) to complete a team exercise that is closely related to the weekly quiz and lecture topics for the week. You will get points for correctly completing a collaborative assignment as a group. (14 discussions x 6 points = 84 points).\nLab Assignment and Quizzes (78 points, 11% of your grade)\nEach weekly lab will require students to complete a laboratory exercise sheet and lab quiz. The quiz will be taken after the lab TA has checked the lab assignment sheet. The lab assignment sheet is worth 3 points and the quiz is worth 3 points. Make sure to sign in and out of lab. (13 labs X 6 points = 78 points).\nSoil Property and Land Use Report (200 points, 27% of your grade)\nOne of the main goals in this course is for you to walk away knowing how to obtain, use, understand and interpret information from soil surveys. This is an important skill that will set you apart in the workforce from people who don’t know how to do this. To support this course objective, you will produce a (4 p.) report that requires you to apply lecture material to real-world land uses in an area of your choosing. This assignment will be submitted in 4 parts throughout the semester, each portion worth 50 points. (4 parts X 50 points = 200 points)",

No curve will be applied. I do not oblige requests for grade “bump-ups” for extra credit at the end off the semester as these requests are not fair to your fellow students and against University policy. However, I do calculate everybody’s final grade with a 0.5% grace. So, in other words, if you are within 0.5% of the next grade category you will receive the higher grade. Be proud of the grade you earned!\n\n\n3.2.3 Grading Challenges\nAny challenges to graded assignments you wish to be considered should be emailed to the TA within one week of the posting date of the graded item.\n\n\n3.2.4 Student Workload Statement\nThis course conforms to the UMN expected time per course credit policy.) Per that policy:\n\nFor all academic sessions, courses, and modalities, hours of instructional time for a course must equal at least the number of credits for the course times 15 weeks in an academic term. 4 credits x 1 hour in class per credit (average) x 15 weeks = 60 hours of instructional time\nOne credit equals 3 hours of work per week (both in and out of class). So, a 4 credit class equals 4 credits x 3 hours/credit = 12 hours per week. 4 credits x 3 hours per week x 15 weeks = 180 hours total\n\nHere is how the course conforms:\n\n\n\nActivity\nNumber\nHours\n\n\n\n\nLectures*\n31\n31 x 1 = 31 hours\n\n\nDiscussions*\n14\n14 x 1 = 14 hours\n\n\nLabs*\n13\n13 x 1 = 13 hours\n\n\nPre-Disc.

Students are free to take reasoned exception to the views offered in any course of study and to reserve judgment about matters of opinion, but they are responsible for learning the content of any course of study for which they are enrolled. Reports of concerns about academic freedom are taken seriously, and there are individuals and offices available for help.

Scholastic dishonesty means plagiarizing; cheating on assignments or examinations; engaging in unauthorized collaboration on academic work; taking, acquiring, or using test materials without faculty permission; submitting false or incomplete records of academic achievement; acting alone or in cooperation with another to falsify records or to obtain dishonestly grades, honors, awards, or professional endorsement; altering, forging, or misusing a University academic record; or fabricating or falsifying data, research procedures, or data analysis. (see Student Conduct Code Section 6.2). If it is determined that a student has cheated, he or she may be given an “F” or an “N” for the course, and may face additional sanctions from the University.\nThe Office for Community Standards provides a wealth of information on the Student Conduct Code and Scholastic Dishonesty. If you have additional questions, please clarify with your instructor for the course. Your instructor can respond to your specific questions regarding what would constitute scholastic dishonesty in the context of a particular class-e.g., whether collaboration on assignments is permitted, requirements and methods for citing sources, if electronic aids are permitted or prohibited during an exam.",
